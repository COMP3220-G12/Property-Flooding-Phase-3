# Property-Flooding
COMP-3220 Group Project Phase 3 (Elaboration Iteration 2)
This repository contains the code that loads data from a .csv file downloaded from the City of Windsor's open dataset about Community Centre locations. Once the data is loaded, it is displayed and can be accessed for different applications. 

One application implemented in this repository is asking the user to enter a street name to show them the history of Flood service requests received by the City of Windsor in the past 5 years.  This is done by searching the records loaded from the open dataset available on the City of Windsor website.  

Another application is displaying individual records of the data (first, last, next, or previous) and also sorting them by any field in the dataset.

This repository is an enhancement of the previous phase product (https://github.com/COMP3220-G12/Property-Flooding) so that the code can be easily adaptable to load and interact with several different types of datasets.

The documentation repository for this repository can be found at: http://www.noor112.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/property-flood-grading-dataset/
